**Project Plan: Vaelix Browser**

---

**Overview**
Vaelix is a next-generation Rust-based browser focused on user autonomy, ultra-deep customization, privacy, modular extensibility, and local-first intelligence. It’s a parallel sibling project to SvaklaAI but designed specifically for web navigation, development tooling, and interactive intelligence—built to match your unique aesthetic and philosophy.

---

**Core Ideals**
- Full user control and extensibility (no hardcoded corporate behavior)
- AI integration with SvaklaAI for advanced browsing, automation, and interaction
- Rust-native safety, security, and performance
- Real-time contextual learning (per-tab memory, web interaction history, dynamic preference learning)
- Clean, hyper-minimal UI inspired by https://vz.strangled.net:777/
- Aesthetic overlays, glows, and interface animation respecting low resource use

---

**Features**

**1. Core Engine & Architecture**
- **Engine:** Leverage Servo for rendering, extend it with custom modules
- **Async-first design:** Use Tokio and async/await for parallelism
- **Multi-process sandboxing:** Full separation of renderer, network, and JS contexts
- **Custom protocol support:** Like `vaelix://`, `vz://`, and others for native user tools

**2. Privacy and Security**
- **Zero telemetry by default**
- **Self-auditing tools:** real-time reports of trackers, scripts, and API calls
- **Custom Firewall Layer:** Add per-tab firewalling rules and smart UFW-style blocklists
- **Encrypted container system:** Each tab/session stored as encrypted modules if enabled

**3. Interface and UX**
- **Theme:** Use tailwind-like token-based design for extreme customization
- **Tabs as Scenes:** Each tab is a 3D-scene-like container, hover-swapping instead of clicking
- **Command palette:** Full keyboard nav with `:` command-line style (like VIM + GNOME launcher)
- **CSS FX:** Support animation frames, color overlays, and modular UI scripts (pure Rust with wasm fallback)

**4. AI Integration**
- **SvaklaAI bridge:** Browser asks SvaklaAI for context when needed (e.g. summarizing a page, translating, scripting page interactions)
- **Memory:** Save user tab interaction history and build local understanding models
- **Auto-enhancement:** Detect and fix broken sites, accessibility, or layout glitches
- **Search Engine Augment:** Use AI to parse results and rank/rewrite queries

**5. Web APIs and Plugins**
- **Plugin system:** Wasm-powered plugins with strict sandboxing, IPC support
- **Port APIs:** Local web API support using ports 992, 776, 440, etc.
- **Custom tool APIs:** User can create tools/scripts like `devutils.vaelix://inspect-css` or `vaelix://extract-pdf`
- **Native JS Rewriter:** Allows real-time JS override without modifying source sites

**6. Dev Focused Tools**
- **DevOverdrive Mode:** Enable GPU-boosted canvas+shader inspection
- **Memory Profiling:** Built-in inspector for JS/DOM/CPU/GPU performance
- **REST & GraphQL Consoles:** With pre-built requests from active tab’s domain
- **WebSocket/HTTP tracker:** Show real-time socket and fetch activity in a mini-UI

**7. File, Bookmark & Tab Handling**
- **Bookmarks as Trees:** Nested, searchable, and taggable
- **Session save/recover system:** Snapshot a moment and restore all tabs, notes, and page positions
- **Filesystem integration:** Direct local file access (e.g. open `/home/dae/logs.txt` in tab)

**8. Setup and Platform**
- **Platform:** Linux-only (for now)
- **Build:** Nix-compatible and targets x86_64 Linux only
- **Deps:** Servo, Dioxus or Leptos (if GUI framework needed), egui/tokio/surf/hyper/reqwest

**9. Unique UX Ideas**
- **Dynamic tab renaming** based on user context
- **Glow trails** when dragging tab, with setting to change color per memory-set
- **Live wallpaper tab background** rendered with shader art (disabled if performance drops)
- **Per-tab AI personality**—select from different SvaklaAI configurations for different sites/tasks

**10. Future Expansions**
- **Firefox/Chrome extension adapter**
- **Wayland surface injection for ultra-custom themes**
- **Fully scriptable window manager inside browser**
- **VaelixOS?** A desktop environment eventually built around it

---

**Initial Launch Goals**
- Static site rendering and basic browsing
- Command palette with navigation
- AI query assistant with SvaklaAI
- Tab memory and note-taking
- Per-tab firewall rule system
- Custom protocol support (vaelix://, vz://)
- Early plugin sandboxing test
- Encrypted tab snapshot system

---

**Ports to Register with UFW**
- 992, 776, 440 (default internal API ports)
- 6969 (debug/diagnostic channel)
- 877 (remote extension sync)
- Optional: 777 (same as website)
